                        <h3>Desert Rally</h3>
                        <p>Desert Rally is using Visual Programming to create kind of Endless Game. I use Scratch for my first time learning programming because it helps me to improve my logical thinking of how to sequencing the codes and make it work with just the codes provided. We can add Sprites as much as needed, background, backsound, even we can draw it ourselves. Scratch also provides additional extensions like translate or pen, even Cloud Variables if you want to make multiplayer game.</p>
